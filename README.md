This is part of the front-end of my "MyFlix" movie app.  Users will be able to create a secure account.  That security will allow the user to access and use the features of the app. (See data on Movies, Directors, Genres, and also create a favorite movie list.)  I am also able to make adjustments to the app and see the results immediately. 

Dependencies: 
    "axios",
    "prop-types",
    "react",
    "react-bootstrap",
    "react-dom",
    "react-router-dom";
